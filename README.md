## Environment Setup for the Latest Version of Laravel (PHP, Nginx, Laravel, MySql) Using Docker

### Project Structure

- `docker` - Folder for all configuration files for docker and other services
    - `nginx` - Folder for nginx configuration files
    - `php` - Folder for php configuration files
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker compose configuration file

- This laravel project uses the Domain Driven Design code structure and logic: the logic of Products and Orders is splitted on Controllers, Services and Repositories under App\Domain namespace

- The interfaces are written entirely in Vue 3 using Inertia.js
- There are endpoints for the interfaces and separated API REST. The API tests are in the Postman collection "Test.postman_collection.json" in the root of the project. 

### Step-by-Step Guide


#### 1. Build the Project Using Docker Compose

- To install the docker engine on Linux, follow this guide https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

- After the Docker installation you can give useful permission to your user

  ```
  sudo usermod -aG docker your-user
  ```

- Download or clone the project

  ```
  sudo git clone https://github.com/lspedalieri/project-test.git
  ```

- After download the project, run the following command to build the Docker containers
  
  ```
  docker compose build
  ```

- The images should have all the required dependencies for PHP 8.2 installed on the system

- kill any web services on port 80 and 3306 on the host machine because can interfere with docker services.

  ```
  sudo service apache2 stop
  ```

- Start docker containers

  ```
  docker compose up -d
  ```

#### 2. Download Laravel dependencies

- Enter in the Docker shell to work directly in the workdir

  ```
  docker compose exec app bash
  ```

#### 3. Configure Laravel project 

-  Run the following commands to install Laravel library and set the configuration:

    ```
    composer install
    ```

- Copy .env.example file in .env

    ```
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    ```
    php artisan key:generate
    ```


- Check DB credentials in .env file
  ```
  DB_CONNECTION=mysql       # connection name, we use mysql
  DB_HOST=mysql             # name of mysql service in docker-compose.yml
  DB_PORT=3306              # mysql standart port 
  DB_DATABASE=app           # database name from MYSQL_DATABASE in 
  DB_USERNAME=root          # username from MYSQL_USER in docker-compose.yml
  DB_PASSWORD=              # user password from MYSQL_PASSWORD in 
  ```

- Exit from Docker shell with CTRL+d and Restart all the services
  
  ```
  docker compose down
  docker compose up -d
  ```
#### 4. Set Node and npm
  
- The project needs Node 20 on the host machine. In the root of the project launch. If nvm is present, just set Node 20
  
  ```
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt install nvm
  nvm install 20
  nvm version 20

- After Node/npm installation, download dependencies and start node server to compile Vue scripts
  
  ```
  npm install
  npm run dev
  ```

#### 5. Run Migrations
- Run migration and seeder from the host machine shell

  ```
  docker compose run --rm artisan migrate
  docker compose run --rm artisan db:seed DatabaseSeeder
  ```

- Or enter in docker shell first
  
  ```
  docker compose exec app bash
  php artisan migrate
  php artisan db:seed DatabaseSeeder
  ```

#### 6. Interfaces

- You can verify if the project is working by opening the browser. For example, if itâ€™s set port 80

  ```
  https://local-test.com
  or
  http://local-test.com
  ```

- Login page (root page or /login)

#### Test
- The endpoints can be found in the Postman collection "Test.postman_collection.json" in the root of the project. 
- Steps:
  - login with credentials "admin@example.com" for admin and "user@example.com" for a user, the password is "password"
  - Use the "service-api" parameter as bearer token in the authorization parameters to use the other api
